Description = "Reading news is essential to keep up with modern technology. My proven method for doing so is using [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/), a powerful news feed aggregator. However, to be able to read my news offline I had to come up with this project in order to download unread articles to my machine."
