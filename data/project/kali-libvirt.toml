Description = "When having to run binaries during a CTF, I feel the urge to run it inside a sandboxed environment, even when knowing the challenge was created in good faith. Previously, I used [Podman](https://podman.io/) as a beautiful [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) alternative. With this project, I aim to move towards using a virtual machine while keeping a similar level of comfort."
