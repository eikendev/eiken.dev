Description = "Inspired by [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) and [Gotify](https://gotify.net/), my intention with this *experimental* project is to build a push notification server that is minimalistic and secure. Since notifications are sent via [Matrix.org](https://matrix.org/), no additional clients need to be maintained. So far it features multiple users and application management."
