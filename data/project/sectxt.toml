Description = "The [security.txt standard](https://securitytxt.org/) was proposed so researchers have a definite endpoint to notify about vulnerabilities on a website. Even though it's only a draft in its current state, some websites have deployed it already. With this tool I want to help track the coverage of the standard among major websites."
