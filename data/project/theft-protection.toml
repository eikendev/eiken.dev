Description = "As the first embedded device I built outside of curricular activity, this project cost me quite a bit of trial and error. The core of the device is an [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano)-compatible board attached to an accelerometer, an NFC reader, and an alarm buzzer. Once armed via NFC, it makes loud noises if moved in any direction."
