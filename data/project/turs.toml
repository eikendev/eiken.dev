Description = "On the command line the prompt is the one thing you will always want to rely on. Since I wanted my prompt to provide very custom functionality and performance, I concluded it's worth implementing it as a separate program. Thankfully, [Purs](https://github.com/xcambar/purs) served as a good starting point."
