Description = "In black-box assessments of Android apps a good decompiler can save a lot of work. Luckily, there are many decompilers freely available, each with their individual strength. To make them easily accessible, I wrote a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image that decompiles your JAR and APK files using multiple decompilers."
