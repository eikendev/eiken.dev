Description = "When researching a specific topic, it occurs to me that I end up reading many [RFCs](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/). Hence, I like to keep a local copy on my machine. Using this tool one can download all RFCs in a matter of seconds and update their library comfortably. This was my first project using Python's <code>asyncio</code> library."
