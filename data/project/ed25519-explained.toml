Description = "Although I'm no cryptographer, I enjoy discovering new techniques that are used in applied cryptography. Since Ed25519 has a particularly good reputation, I went ahead trying to understand how its reference implementation was written. While doing so, I documented the code to make it easier to read for other adventurers."
